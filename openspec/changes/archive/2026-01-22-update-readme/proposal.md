# Update README Documentation

## Goal
Enhance the project documentation (`README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md`) by adding Status Badges (CI, Codecov) to reflect the current engineering quality and provide quick feedback on the project's health.

## Changes
- Add **CI Build Status** badge.
- Add **Codecov Coverage** badge.
- Ensure consistency between English and Chinese documentation.

## Why
Users and contributors look for these badges to assess the reliability and maintenance status of the project.
